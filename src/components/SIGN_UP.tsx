<Header as='h2'>Dogs Roles with Humans</Header>
<p>
Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from
their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex
body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and
communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and
ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these
attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled
them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.
